### Welcome to my DailyCodingProblem Repository!
I am on a really cool email list called from dailycodingproblem.com. Daily, I receive an email from them that contains a coding problem that has actually been asked during a job interview from one of several well=known tech companies. These coding challenges are short and sweet and often make you think...hard.

This repository contains solutions for various coding problems that I have received. All coding problems are contained within their own directory. Some coding problems will contain multiple files, others, just one.
